Essential Improvements:

Java code now standard has three entry points,beans, components, and rest. iet would be nice to have an entry point
 less deep for example to put connector/DOA classes.
There can be only one BaseComponent, however for some plugins you would like to add and use some methods in the
BaseComponent, it would be nice if there was a standard empty BaseComponent, and you could add methods to these
 from your instructions.xml
Which stuff in the BaseComponent in gogreen is mandatory?
It would be nice to include some base templates with space for draggable components with essentials
It would be nice if you could add pieces to the web.xml
It would be nice if it would be possible to install plugins with dependencies in one go, when there are no dependencies
 to essentails this should not be a problem.

Finalist Plugins:

Profile-component
Some java code of essentials was changed in order to add <type>pom</type> to
the ehcache dependency in pom.xml of the site. This is done when setting the
'depType' property in the plugin_descriptor.json.

To really use the profile component the empty implementations need
to be replaced with project specific esb/rest connectors in the spring
configuration located in the overrides folder.
