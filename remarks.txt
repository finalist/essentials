Java code now standard has three entry points,beans, components, and rest. iet would be nice to have an entry point
less deep for example to put connector/DOA classes.
There can be only one BaseComponent, however for some plugins you would like to add and use some methods in the
BaseComponent, it would be nice if there was a standard empty BaseComponent, and you could add methods to these
 from your instructions.xml
